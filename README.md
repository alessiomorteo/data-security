# Data Security
* This repo is to focus on trialling some basic demonstration of api security, serving as an educational tool to myself primarily.
* The key idea is to create a safe and unsafe flask based api, showing the use of a SQL injection and how to avoid it through contrasting the two api's.
* The main tools to be used are python, flask, MySQL, Docker, and more.
